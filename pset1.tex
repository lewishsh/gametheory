\subsection*{Problem 1}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $X\to y$ denote $X$ approaching $y$ in that round of the algorithm.
  The generation of $\mu_M$ proceeds as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $A\to a,\ B\to d,\ C\to d,\ D\to a,\ E\to a$, generating the incomplete
    matching: $\langle Aa, Bd\rangle$.
  \item $C\to c,\ D\to d,\ E\to b$, getting $\langle Aa, Cc, Dd, Eb\rangle$.
  \item $B\to b$, getting $\langle Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd\rangle$.
  \item $E\to d$ and getting rejected---that's the last person on his list, no
    changes occur and the algorithm terminates.
  \end{enumerate}
  Thus $\mu_M = \langle Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd, E\rangle$.
  $\mu_W$ goes:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $a\to B,\ b\to C,\ c\to E,\ d\to A$, getting $\langle Ad,Ba,Cb\rangle$.
  \item $c\to D$, getting $\langle Ad, Ba, Cb, Dc$, and thus all the women are
    matched.
  \end{enumerate}
  Hence $\mu_W = \langle Ad, Ba, Cb, Dc, E\rangle$.
\item The procedure proceeds:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $A\to a,\ B\to d,\ C\to d,\ D\to a,\ E\to a$, generating the incomplete
    matching: $\langle Bd, Da\rangle$.
  \item $A\to b, C\to c,\ E\to b$, getting $\langle Ab, Bd, Cc, Da\rangle$.
  \item $E\to d$, getting $\langle Ab, Cc, Da, Ed\rangle$.
  \item $B\to c$, getting $\langle Ab, Bc, Da, Ed\rangle$.
  \item $C\to a$, getting $\langle Ab, Bc, Ca, Ed\rangle$.
  \item $D\to d$, getting $\langle Ab, Bc, Ca, Dd\rangle$.
  \item E has no more people on his list so the procedure terminates.
  \end{enumerate}
  The matching is thus $\langle Ab, Bc, Ca, Dd, E\rangle$, which is preferable
  for $a$ as she prefers $B$ to $A$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 2}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item As proved in class, the MPP and WPP yield the ``boy-best'' and
  ``girl-best'' matchings respectively. The MPP goes: (I've switched the order
  of men and women in the matching for convenience)
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $U\to a,\ V\to b,\ W\to d,\ X\to c,\ Y\to a,\ Z\to d$, yielding $\langle
    aY, bV, cX, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $U\to b,\ W\to c$, yielding $\langle aY, bU, cW, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $V\to d,\ X\to b$, yielding $\langle aY, bU, cW, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $V\to a,\ X\to a$, yielding $\langle aV, bU, cW, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $X\to d,\ Y\to b$, yielding $\langle aV, bU, cW, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $Y\to c$, yielding $\langle aV, bU, cY, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $W\to b$, yielding $\langle aV, bW, cY, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $U\to c$, yielding $\langle aV, bW, cY, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $U\to d$, yielding $\langle aV, bW, cY, dZ\rangle$
  \end{enumerate}
  Thus our final matching is $\langle aV, bW, cY, dZ, X, U\rangle$. For the WPP:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $a\to V,\ b\to W,\ c\to V,\ d\to Z$ gives $\langle aV, bW, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $c\to Z$ gives $\langle aV, bW, dZ\rangle$.
  \item $c\to Y$ gives $\langle aV, bW, cY, dZ\rangle$, and as every woman is
    matched, the procedure finishes.
  \end{enumerate}
  Thus the final ``girl-best'' matching is $\langle aV, bW, cY, dZ, U, X\rangle$
  , which is the same as the ``boy-best'' one.
\item Using the same process:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item The first stage gives: $\langle Xabc, Yeg, Zhik\rangle$.
  \item $d\to X,\ f\to Z,\ j\to Y\rangle$, thus $\rangle Xabcd, Yeg, Zhik\rangle$.
  \item $f\to X, j\to X$, thus $\langle Xacdf, Yeg, Zhik\rangle$.
  \item $b\to Y$, thus $\langle Xacdf, Yeg, Zhik\rangle$.
  \item $b\to Z$, thus $\langle Xacdf, Yeg, Zhik\rangle$, and the algorithm
    terminates.
  \end{enumerate}
  Thus the final matching is $\langle Xacdf, Yeg, Zhik, b, j\rangle$.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 3}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Suppose not: there exist $A$ and $B$, both pointing at $x$. $x$ either
  prefers $A$ or $B$ (say $A$), but then the matching in which $Bx$
  supposedly exists is unstable, as in that one $x$ prefers $A$ and $A$ prefers
  $x$ (as by assumption, $A$ prefers $x$ of the two wives from the two matchings).
\item Let $\mu^*$ be the matching in (a), and $A$ be a man in the profile.
  Any woman $x$ who prefers $A$ to her current husband is matched to that
  husband in a stable matching, and in that matching $A$ prefers his wife to her,
  else it wouldn't be stable. $A$'s current wife is his preferred one out of
  the two he's matched with in $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$, so is preferred over
  $x$. Thus no man is preferred by a woman he doesn't prefer, and $\ms$ is
  stable.
\item Suppose not: suppose in $\ms$ some woman $x$ is matched with a husband
  she prefers out of the two; in other words, let's say $\ms$ contains the
  couple $Ax$, $A$ preferring $x$ to the other woman $y$ out of the two
  matchings (by the definition of $\ms$),
  and $x$ preferring $A$ over $B$, the other husband out of the two
  matchings. Then in the matching in which
  $A$ and $x$ aren't matched, they both prefer each other to their husband/wife,
  which violates our assumption that it's a stable matching.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 4}

Lemma: Problem 3 implies the uniqueness of men- and women-optimal matchings.
Suppose not, and let $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ be men-optimal matchings. Then by the
process in 3a, a new matching can be generated that is better than both for
men---each man being paired with the preferred wife out of the two. If the final
matching is the same as $\mu_1$ or $\mu_2$, it means that one is superior to the
other, violating our assumption. The same argument can be made for women-optimal
matchings.

Proof of statement: suppose not, that there exists some $\mu_2$ differing from
our men- and women-optimal matching $\mu_1$; that means there exists some
matching in $\mu_1$, say $Aa$, that is not in $\mu_2$. Who are $A$ and $a$
matched to in $\mu_2$? By the optimality of $\mu_1$, they must both be matched
to worse people, otherwise $\mu_1$ isn't uniquely optimal for men or women (at
least one of them would be matched with a preferred person and be better off).
But then $\mu_2$ is unstable, as $A$ and $a$ prefer each other to their
spouses. Thus $\mu_1$ is unique. 

\subsection*{Problem 5}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item The cycles for this procedure are $(CFG)$, $(A)$, $(BE)$, $(DH)$,
    in each step, giving
    us the allocation \[\langle Aa, Be, Cf, Dh, Eb, Fg, Gc, Hd\rangle.\]
  \item  The cycles are $(C)$, $(E)$, $(F)$, $(D)$, $(AB)$, (again, one in each
    step), and the final
    allocation is \[\langle Ab, Ba, Cc, Dd, Ee, Ff\rangle.\]
  \end{enumerate}
\item We want to show that no coalition can block $a'$ on earth.
  $A$ and $C$ get their top choices, so they won't be part of any coalitions,
  as on earth participants join coalitions only if they're better off through
  them. Thus the only remaining possible coalition is $\{B,D\}$, which gives
  allocations $\langle Bb, Dd\rangle$ or $\langle Bd, Db\rangle$. But both
  are better off in $a'$, so these coalitions also don't form. Thus $a'$ is in
  the core.
\item Clearly $A$ and $C$ are just as well off, and $B$ and $D$ prefer $c$ and
  $a$ better than $a$ and $c$ respectively, so $a'$ is weakly dominated by the
  allocation giving traders their first choice.
\item TTC gives the cycles $(A),\ (C),\ (BD)$ in the first step, and terminates.
  As proved in class, the resultant allocation, $\langle Ab, Bc, Cd, Da\rangle$
  is the only strictly stable solution and thus the only solution in the core.

  The core consists of all allocations that wouldn't be blocked by earth given
  $a'$ as a starting allocation; i.e. it's an allocation in which there is no
  coalition which in $a'$ is strictly better off or in which a cycle through
  the coalition starting from $a'$ leaves them strictly better off. Note,
  however, that because $A$ and $C$ have their ideal houses, the only
  allocation that weakly dominates $a'$ is that given by the TTC
  ($B$ and $D$ can only swap houses, if they are not to make $A$ or $C$ worse
  off). Finally, $a'$ itself isn't in the core, as $B$ and $D$ are better by
  swapping. Thus our core also consists of only the TTC allocation.

\end{enumerate}
