\subsection*{Introduction}

John Harsanyi, in the 1959 paper ``A bargaining model for the cooperative n-person
game,'' proposed a procedure for dissolving a partnership in which the overall
value of the partnership is more than the sum of what they each contributed to it.
Given that each partner may have brought something of a different worth to the
table, and different groups within the partnership may also have made their own
collective contributions, the question of how the overall assets are to be
distributed to each is a complicated one.

Harsanyi's procedure rests on the intuition that each partner, or subgroup,
should recoup what they contributed, and what remains should be distributed
evenly to all. In this paper I describe and demonstrate the procedure and prove
that the outcome coincides with the Shapley value of the partnership.

\subsection*{The Procedure}

I formalize the notion of a partnership and its contributors as follows: let
$N = \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ be partners, and let $v(S)$ with $S \subseteq N$ be
the worth or contribution of all members of $S$ collectively. This means, for
example, that $v(1,2)$ is the sum of all the contributions of $1$ and 2 as
individuals, and of their contribution as a pair. Thus $v(N)$ is the total
worth of the partnership being dissolved, and is the amount that must be divided
amongst the partners.
Note that it is
possible for the contributions of a collective to be negative, or less than
the sum of its parts, because the collective may have made a poor decision,
so both $v(A) + v(B) \leq v(A\cup B)$ and $v(A) + v(B) \geq v(A\cup C)$ are
possible. Finally, note that $v$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{P(N)}$, where
$P(N)$ is the power set of $N$ (we exclude the null set from $P(N)$ for
convenience here), and that other ``games,'' i.e. other situations, can be
obtained for the same set of partners with other vectors $v'\in \mathbb{R}^{P(N)}$.

The procedure works as follows: any coalition $S\subset N$ is chosen, $v(S)$
is divided equally among the members of $S$, and $v(S)$ is subtracted from all
components of $v$ containing $S$ to yield some $v_1$.\footnote{As in $v_1(R) =
  v(R)-v(S)$ if $S \subseteq R$, and $v(R)$ otherwise.} This procedure repeats,
with $v_1, v_2\ldots v_k$ replacing $v$ and coalitions $S$ with $v_i(S)\neq 0$
selected until some $v_k = 0$ is reached.

\paragraph{Example}
I dissolve the partnership represented by:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
S    & 1  & 2  & 3 & 1,2 & 1,3 & 2,3 & 1,2,3 \\ \hline
v(S) & 30 & 12 & 6 & 36  & 36  & 30  & 90    \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

I use the same notation as in the reading: on the left I indicate the chosen
coalition (``claimant'') leading to the game on that line (this is a slight
deviation from the reading, but I think it makes more intuitive sense), in
the middle the value of each successive game,
and on the right how much each partner gets from each distribution.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

I proceed to prove two propositions about the procedure.

\subsection*{Termination}

I first show that the procedure terminates regardless of which coalitions are
chosen at each step. The proof by contradiction. Suppose the statement is false,
then there exists an infinite sequence of coalitions $\{S_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ such
that $v_{n}(S_n)\neq 0$, with (for convenience we let $v_0 = v$, the original
game)---as the procedure terminates when no coalition with nonzero value exists.

As $|P(N)|$ is finite, there must be coalitions appearing infinitely many times
in $\{S_n\}$, and there must be a smallest (though not necessarily strictly
smallest) coalition appearing infinitely many times. Note then two facts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item During some round $i$ of a procedure, for all $S \subseteq N$ with $|S|
  \leq |S_i|$ and $S \neq S_i$, $v_{i+1}(S) = v_i(S)$,
  where $S_i$ is the chosen coalition for that
  round. This is because given those conditions $S_i \not\subseteq S$, thus
  $v_{i+1}(S) = v_i(S)$ by the definition of $v_{i+1}$.
\item If $S_i$ is the chosen coalition in round $i$, $v_{i+1}(S_i) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
Thus if $S$ is the smallest coalition that repeats infinitely, then there is some
point in $\{S_n\}$ in which all the coalitions subsequently chosen are either the
same size or greater than $S$. Thus the next time $S$ is chosen, say in turn
$i$, $v_{i+1}(S) = 0$, and because each subsequent $S_i$ is of equal size or
larger than $S$, $v_k(S)$ remains as 0 for all $k > i$, and thus cannot be chosen
again, contradicting the assumption that $S$ repeats infinitely.
